# Note-taking
This software is one of my University coursework which is why I cannot upload the code at this moment. This is just to show what I have done at University. To get the source code, message me privately.

This program was written in Java using Netbeans. The program doesn't conenct to the database automatically, it had to be manually connected (Which is not avaiable with the executable .jar).
